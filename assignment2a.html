        <h1>Emma 2020</h1>

        <p>A genre of movies I like is period dramas. 
            One of my favorite period dramas is the 2020 adaptation of <em>Emma (2020)</em>. 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_(2020_film)" title = "Emma" target="_blank">Emma</a> is about a wealthy young woman who interferes in the relationships of her friends. 
            Emma often acts in selfish ways and has to deal with the consequences of her bad matchmaking. 
            It's always interesting when the protagonist of a movie is portrayed as a flawed individual. 
            Not only is the movie <em>very</em> visually stunning, but the fashion is also <strong>really</strong> interesting as the movie is set in the early 1800s.
